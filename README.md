# Active Character Portrait
Adds a window that displays the name and portrait of the users current active/selected character from the user configuration menu. Click on the portrait to open a custom character selection menu and click on an icon to change active character.

## Pinning
On both the portrait and character selector window there is a pin button in the top right, next to the button to close the window. Clicking this button will save the windows size and position meaning any time you open that window again it should be in the same size and in the same place. This only saves that information on a per user and per game basis

## Bypass Esc key close
If you enable the option in the settings menu, the portrait window will no longer close when you hit the 'Esc' key to close all open windows. You can still close the window manually with 'x' button on the portrait window header
