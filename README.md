# Active Character Portrait
Adds a window that displays the name and portrait of the users current active/selected character from the user configuration menu. Click on the portrait to open a custom character selection menu and click on an icon to change active character.

## Portrait
The portrait window will show the art for the character that currently represents you. Left clicking the portrait will open the character sheet for that character. Right clicking the portrait will open a window to select a different character to represent you.

## Bypass Esc key close
If you enable the option in the settings menu, the portrait window will no longer close when you hit the 'Esc' key to close all open windows. You can still close the window manually with 'x' button on the portrait window header
